  The Civics Examination in the United States dates back to the early 19th century. It has undergone several dynamic changes, but the most important being a gravitation towards questions related to constitutional principles in the 20th century, as opposed to general facts about the country. 

  In 2022, 88% of all civics test takers passed on their initial examination. This rate jumped to 95% when counting the people who passed after re-examination, according to the U.S. citizenship and Immigration Services website.
  
  Since 2009, the rate of passing the cumulative exam has decreased slightly from 93.6% to around 90.7%. 
  
  Compiled here are questions asked on the civics exam, available in both English and Spanish. Do you think you could pass the exam?
