          <p>The Civics Examination in the United States dates back to the early 19th century. It has undergone several dynamic changes, but the most important being a gravitation towards questions related to constitutional principles in the 20th century, as opposed to general facts about the country.</p> 

         <p>In 2022, 88% of all civics test takers passed on their initial examination. This rate jumped to 95% when counting the people who passed after re-examination, according to the U.S. citizenship and Immigration Services website.</p>

         <p>Since 2009, the rate of passing the cumulative exam has decreased slightly from 93.6% to around 90.7%.</p>

         <p>Compiled here are questions asked on the civics exam, available in both English and Spanish. Do you think you could pass the exam?</p>
